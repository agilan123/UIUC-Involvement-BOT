I'm hesitant to add another good review of this great place because I didn't have to fight anyone for a table, and I would like to be able get one in the future.\\n\\nAnyway... I'm a huge fan of brunch (and especially of Mexican/Latin American-type brunches), so I was thrilled to try this place. My friend ordered the Verde Vaqueros, which are their verison of biscuits and gravy. But the biscuits are no ordinary biscuits, they're Green chile beer biscuits (!) with smoked sausage gravy from Schreiners. The biscuits were delicious. I could eat them with anything... or really without anything else. My friend cleaned his plate. I got the stacked chicken enchiladas because I'm a sucker for anything with hatch chiles, and they did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful, and the crispy tortillas were a nice texture contrast to the rest of the dish.\\n\\nWill definitely be back, and would definitely recommend that people check this place out for brunch... just don't take my table.\",\n          \"Kabuki was great....A lovely little middle-of-the-afternoon oasis found in Tempe Marketplace!  I scoped out the menu had some some sushi for happy hour, including some rare beef sashimi, some unusual and unique rolls and complimentary edamame.  Although I did not dine here for a full meal, I feel justified in expressing my enjoyment of their happy hour.  The tiny bar was cozy and the service was good.  The happy hour prices were enticing and I would definitely return for it:)  Although for my personal taste the ambiance of Kabuki seemed a little too corporate for me I definitely would return for their happy hour and maybe to sample other menu items.  I will keep you posted on my next visit:)\",\n          \"Whew!  What a hike.  Coming from Colorado, though, the relative comparison makes it just a 3.  \\n\\nFirstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). \\n\\nIt was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.  If you go, just be wary of the sun/heat, and know that you'll be clambering over and around boulders and such.  (If you trip, it's CURTAINS!)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stars\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          1,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
